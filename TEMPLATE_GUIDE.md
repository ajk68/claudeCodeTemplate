# Claude Code Development Template

A battle-tested template for AI-assisted development that transforms Claude from a code generator into a reliable engineering partner.

## What This Template Provides

### üéØ Intelligent Context Management
- **Problem**: AI gets lost in large codebases, context window fills with irrelevant information
- **Solution**: Tiered context generation and smart delegation to specialized AI models
- **Result**: Claude stays focused on your task while having access to all necessary information

### üîç Reality-Grounded Development
- **Problem**: AI hallucinates functions, patterns, and "best practices" that don't exist
- **Solution**: Multiple verification layers - real files, real docs, real database schemas
- **Result**: AI suggestions based on what actually exists, not what it imagines

### üîÑ Continuous Quality Feedback
- **Problem**: Bugs compound, bad patterns proliferate, quality degrades over time
- **Solution**: Automated hooks, linting, and verification at every step
- **Result**: Problems caught immediately, not after hours of wrong-direction work

### üõ†Ô∏è Specialized Development Workflows
- **Problem**: One-size-fits-all AI interactions lead to confusion and poor results
- **Solution**: Purpose-built commands for each development phase
- **Result**: Clear progression from idea ‚Üí planning ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí shipping

### üìä Centralized Logging & Debugging
- **Problem**: Scattered logs across terminals, browser consoles, and files make debugging hard
- **Solution**: Unified logging system that combines all sources with AI analysis
- **Result**: Single source of truth for debugging with AI-powered log analysis

## Quick Start

### Method 1: GitHub Template (Recommended)
1. **Click "Use this template"** button on GitHub
2. **Clone your new repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-new-repo-url> my-project
   cd my-project
   ```
3. **Run the setup wizard**:
   ```bash
   make setup   # Runs interactive setup
   ```

### Method 2: Manual Clone
1. **Clone the template**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claudeCodeTemplate my-project
   cd my-project
   ```
2. **Run setup** (will detect and protect template):
   ```bash
   make setup   # Will disconnect from template repo
   ```

### After Setup
1. **Start Claude Code**:
   ```bash
   claude
   ```
2. **Try a workflow command**:
   ```
   /status              # See current project state
   /brainstorm          # Start exploring an idea
   /implement           # Execute code changes
   ```

### üîß Make Commands

**Context & Analysis**:
- `make generate-context-python` - Python files only (~40K tokens)
- `make generate-context-small` - Compressed overview (~60K tokens)
- `make ai-analyze-project` - Full project analysis with AI
- `make code-search` - Fast pattern searching

**Quality & Testing**:
- `make test` - Run test suite
- `make lint` - Check code quality
- `make format` - Auto-format code

**Development**:
- `make project-status` - Current state summary
- `make dev` - Run all services with unified logging
- `make logs-watch` - Watch combined logs in real-time
- `make analyze-logs` - AI-powered log analysis
- `make review-diff` - Review pending changes

### üí¨ Workflow Commands

**Strategic Planning**:
- `/brainstorm` - Explore ideas with data-driven insights
- `/architect` - Create technical implementation plans

**Execution**:
- `/implement` - Write code (handles both features and fixes)
- `/test` - Verify functionality
- `/ship` - Finalize and commit changes

**Support**:
- `/status` - Quick orientation without context pollution
- `/review` - Get peer-review style feedback
- `/document` - Update documentation to match reality

## Core Principles

### 1. Context Preservation
- Main Claude instance stays focused on the task
- Information gathering delegated to specialized agents
- Smart model selection based on content size

### 2. Reality Anchoring
- Always read actual files, never rely on memory
- Check real documentation via Context7
- Verify against actual database schemas
- Research current practices via Perplexity

### 3. Continuous Verification
- Automated formatting and linting after edits
- Test execution at multiple checkpoints
- Smart blockers prevent common mistakes
- Human approval required for major decisions

### 4. Pragmatic Constraints
- Prefer modifying existing code over creating new files
- No abstractions without 3+ existing uses
- No mocks or fixtures - real data only
- Clear decision points, no implicit assumptions

## Customization Guide

### Setting Up Centralized Logging
1. **Configure your Procfile** - Copy `Procfile.example` to `Procfile` and list your services
2. **Frontend setup** - The template includes vite-console-forward-plugin pre-configured
3. **Run services** - Use `make dev` to start all processes with unified logging
4. **Monitor logs** - Use `make logs-watch` for real-time monitoring

**Attribution**: Process management via shoreman.sh (in make/tools/) from mitsuhiko/minibb, inspired by mitsuhiko's workflows and many others.

### Adding Project Commands

#### Slash Commands
Create markdown files in `.claude/commands/`:
```bash
echo "Your custom prompt here" > .claude/commands/my-command.md
# Use as: /my-command
```

#### Make Commands
Add project-specific make targets to `make/project.mk`:
```makefile
# Example: Development server
.PHONY: dev-server
dev-server: ## Start development server
	uv run python manage.py runserver

# Example: Database migrations
.PHONY: migrate
migrate: ## Run database migrations
	uv run python manage.py migrate
```

The template's `make/project.mk` file is intentionally empty - it's where you add commands specific to your project without modifying the core template files.

### Setting Up Hooks
Configure in `.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Write|Edit",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "make format"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

### Personal Configuration
Your personal settings in `~/.claude/` (not tracked in git):
- Custom hooks for your workflow
- Personal command shortcuts
- Notification preferences

## Philosophy

This template embodies the principle that **AI is most effective as a partner, not a replacement**. It creates a cognitive exoskeleton that:

- Amplifies human decision-making with AI-powered information gathering
- Prevents common failure modes through systematic processes
- Maintains quality through continuous verification
- Scales expertise through codified best practices

The goal isn't to make Claude autonomous, but to make the human-AI team more capable than either could be alone.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) CLI tool
- Python with `uv` package manager
- Node.js and npm
- ripgrep (`rg`) for fast searching
- Git for version control

## Getting Help

1. Check the built-in help: `/tools` command
2. Review workflow examples in `.claude/commands/`
3. See the Makefile for all available automation

Remember: The commands and workflows are guides, not rules. Adapt them to your needs and let the template evolve with your project.
